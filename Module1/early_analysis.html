        Ever Wondered How Society Made Sense of Data Before the Age of
        Computers?

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In today's world, we are spoiled with a plethora of advanced software
          and computing power that help us sort, analyze, and interpret vast
          amounts of data. From machine learning algorithms to big data
          analytics, the tools at our disposal are incomparably sophisticated.
          But have you ever stopped to wonder how society made sense of data
          before the digital age? Here's a brief journey through time to explore
          how people navigated the realm of data in the past.

      <section>
        <h2>1800s: The Age of Basic Tools</h2>
        <h3>Hand-Drawn Graphs</h3>
        <p>
          Long before the invention of electronic spreadsheets, people relied on
          hand-drawn graphs to visualize data. William Playfair, a Scottish
          engineer and political economist, is credited with inventing various
          types of graphs like the line graph, bar chart, and pie chart in the
          late 18th century.

            <img src="playfair.png" alt="William Playfair" class="img-fluid" />
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="piechart.png" alt="Pie Chart" class="img-fluid" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Birth of Averages</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of the "average" became a popular tool for summarizing
          data. Simple measures like mean, median, and mode were the go-to
          metrics for understanding large datasets. These were especially useful
          in fields like astronomy, where data points were collected manually
          through telescopic observations.
        </p>

        <h3>Census Taking</h3>
        <p>
          Governments started to realize the importance of data for governance
          and began conducting censuses. The data collected was usually
          tabulated manually and used to make informed decisions about resource
          allocation.
        </p>

        <h3>Probability Theory</h3>
        <p>
          The 19th century also saw significant developments in probability
          theory, spurred in part by interests in games of chance. This laid the
          groundwork for more complex statistical analysis in the future.

            <h3>Statistical Sampling</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            With the rise of mass production and increased complexity in social
          systems, it became impractical to collect data from every individual
          item or person. Statistical sampling techniques, like random sampling,
          became vital for making generalizations about larger populations.

          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
          The early to mid-20th century saw the development of hypothesis
          testing as a standard method for drawing conclusions from data. The
          t-test, Chi-square test, and ANOVA became common statistical methods
          used in research across various fields.

            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
          As datasets became more complex, statistical theories expanded to
          accommodate multiple variables. Techniques like regression analysis,
          factor analysis, and principal component analysis became essential
          tools in the statistician's toolbox.

        <h3>Birth of Computational Statistics</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
          Though not yet in the age of personal computers, the latter half of
          the 20th century witnessed the use of mainframe computers for more
          complicated statistical calculations. This era set the stage for the
          computational power that we take for granted today.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          While we may have advanced computational tools at our fingertips
          today, it's fascinating to see how far we've come from the rudimentary
          methods of the past. The journey of data analysis is a testament to
          human ingenuity and the relentless quest for understanding the world
          through numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the next time you run a complex machine learning algorithm or
          visualize data in a flashy dashboard, take a moment to appreciate the
          centuries of statistical thought that laid the foundation for our
          modern capabilities.
